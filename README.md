# Geospatial Analysis for Shaping Public Policy

## Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at conducting geospatial analysis to inform and shape public policy decisions. The project focuses on identifying risk areas and evaluating potential solutions for population relocation, with a special focus on low-income communities. The goal is to leverage geographic data to propose solutions that enhance safety and reduce vulnerability, especially for at-risk populations.

## Project Files

- **Aaron_risk_data.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that processes risk data to identify high-risk geographic zones. The analysis focuses on areas that are most vulnerable to environmental or social factors that could affect public health and safety.
  
- **LowerIncomeAreas.ipynb**: This notebook analyzes the intersection of socioeconomic factors and geographic risk. It identifies lower-income areas that are in high-risk zones, with a focus on providing data-driven insights for relocation or policy interventions.

- **README.md**: This file. It provides an overview and description of the project and its structure.

## Key Features
- **Geospatial Data Analysis**: Process and analyze geographic data to evaluate environmental risks.
- **Socioeconomic Analysis**: Cross-reference risk zones with socioeconomic data to identify vulnerable populations.
- **Policy Insights**: Provide data-driven insights and recommendations to help shape public policy for safer and more sustainable urban planning.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis using libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `geopandas`.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive analysis and visualizations.
- **Geospatial Libraries**: `geopandas`, `shapely`, and `folium` for working with geographic data and visualizations.
